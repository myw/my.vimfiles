My .vim files
=============

Finally got around to organizing my .vim directory in a sane manner.

I use `vim-plug` to organize all of my non-custom plugins. When setting this up on a new computer, simply running `:PlugInstall` should install all of the configured plugins correctly. For YouCompleteMe, however, there is a secondary compilation step.

My custom plugins are divided into _personal_, which should apply anywhere, and other folders which I may or may not care about, depending on my work environment.
